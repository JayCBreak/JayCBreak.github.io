            Hi, my name is Jacob! I love learning new things, especially in the areas of math, science, and engineering. When I'm not studying, you can usually find me playing video games. Some of my current favourites are Celeste and Minecraft. In the future, I hope to work in the field of cybersecurity, specifically doing low-level researching on malware. When I'm not busy with school or work, I love to read fantasy books like Harry Potter, 1984, and Blood Song. Another one of my favorite pastimes is traveling and going on hikes in nature.
        </p>
